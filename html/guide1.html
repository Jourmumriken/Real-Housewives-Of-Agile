          <h2> Symptoms of a dirty lens </h2>
          <p>
            If you notice your camera taking blurry pictures despite your best efforts,
            or something appearing blurry at the edges of your photos, then this might be due to a dirty lens.
            Check the lens visually for grime, especially near the edges of the lens where it usually accumulates.
            Even if you cannot see any dirt the lens may still be dirty, so try cleaning it anyway!

          <h2> Cleaning </h2>
          <p> 
            Use the toothpick to remove any visual dirt on the lenses edges.
            Be gentle so that you do not scratch the lens.
            Put a small amount of your chosen cleaning liquid on the lens.
            Use the microfiber cloth over your finger and gently but firmly polish the lens and remove grime.
            If you are using a qtip then simply rub it gently over the lens.
            Repeat this again untill the lens is clean.

          <h2> Conclusion </h2>
          <p> 
            You have made it to the end of the guide, good job! 
            You should now have a clean lens!
            If you can see smudging on the lens you may have used a liquid that did come off cleanly.
            If this is the case you can repeat the cleaning with a proper liquid, pure isopropanol is recomended as it evaportaes fully.
            We use a wooden stick as to not scratch the lens, many lenses are made of gemstones so that they will be more scratch resistant, however this is nto always the case.
            This may also be used to clean the flash if it has a similar cover to the lens.
