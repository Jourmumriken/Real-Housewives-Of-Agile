            <h1>Why repair?</h1>

            <h2>The E-Waste Problem</h2>
            <p>In 2019, the global amount of e-waste reached a staggering 53.6 million metric tons—an increase of 58% in less than 10 years. That number is estimated to reach 73 million by 2030, making it the world’s fastest-growing waste stream.</p>
            <p>Around 56% of broken devices are not repaired but instead simply thrown away.</p>
            <p>Only about 17.4% of global e-waste is properly recycled, while the rest ends up in landfills or is incinerated.</p>
            <p>The growing scale of e-waste not only threatens the environment but also results in the loss of valuable resources, such as rare earth metals, that could be recovered through proper recycling or reuse.</p>

            <h2>Why Repair Matters</h2>
            <p>Repairing electronics instead of discarding them offers numerous benefits. First, repairing extends the lifespan of devices, reducing the demand for new products and slowing the extraction of raw materials used in manufacturing.</p>
            <p>It also helps cut down on e-waste, which is becoming a global environmental issue.</p>
            <p>Repairing is often more affordable than replacing an item, saving consumers money while giving their gadgets a second life. Additionally, learning to repair can encourage people to reduce their reliance on manufacturers for costly repairs.</p>
            <p>Repair also supports a circular economy, where products are designed, used, and reused more sustainably, keeping materials in use for as long as possible. By choosing repair over replacement, we can conserve natural resources, reduce pollution, and contribute to a more sustainable future.</p>

            <h2>Useful Tools</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide">iFixit</a>: The largest resource for electronics repair guides, offering comprehensive step-by-step instructions.</li>
              <li><a href="https://monindicedereparabilite.fr/home">Repairability Index by Spareka</a> (French only): It rates various products based on five different categories to set a repairability score.</li>
              <li><a href="https://www.ecolabelindex.com/ecolabels/">The Environmental Labels Index</a>: Shows a list of various labels belonging to organizations that ensure products adhere to certain sustainability requirements.</li>
              <li><a href="https://www.repaircafe.org/en/">Repair Café Foundation</a>: A global network of volunteer-based repair cafes, where people can get help repairing electronics and other products.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The 17 Sustainable Development Goals</h2>
            <p>RepairHub mainly supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12, which focuses on Responsible Consumption and Production. By enabling individuals to repair their electronics rather than discard them, we help reduce e-waste, minimize resource extraction, and promote a circular economy. Goal 12 emphasizes the importance of using resources more efficiently, reducing waste generation, and ensuring sustainable management of the materials we consume. Through self-repair and extending the lifespan of electronic products, we are contributing to a more sustainable world where consumers can make informed, eco-friendly choices.</p>
