        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> This is a sample guide.
            It will teach you how to clean a charging port.
            This is often required on mobile devices such as phones.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="section2">
        <h2> Setup </h2>
        <p> You will need for this:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Toothpicks or small wooden skewers</li>
            <li>Some cotton (otional)</li>
            <li>Isopropanol (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Make sure to be on a clean and non-delicate surface. </p>
      </section> 
      <br>
      <section id="section3">
        <h2> Cleaning </h2>
        <p> Use the toothpick or wooden skewer to carefully poke any grime out.
            Make sure to be gentle and not bend anything.
            (Optional) Once most things are out put a small bit of cotton on the toothpick.
            Wrap it tightly and apply a small amount of alcohol to the cotton.
            Use the alcohol swab to clean out any remaining grime in the port, again being carefull not to damage anything.
            Let the port dry off from any residual alcohl and resume using as normal.
        </p>

      <section id="section4">
        <h2> Good to know </h2>Y
        <p> The carging port may become clogged with dirt or gunk after regular use of a device.
            The contacts in the port may be damaged by a metal pin other hard material, this is why a wooden toothpick or skewer was chosen.
            A plastic skewer would have also sufficed.
            Cleaning a port in this way is a normal mantinance task and should be done regularly or as needed.

        <h2> Conclusion </h2>
        <p> You have made it to the end of the guide, good job!
            The charging port should now be ready to use as normal.
            If any issues with charging or otherwise persist there may be another issue.
            If this is the case there might be something wrong with the port itself and further action must be taken.
