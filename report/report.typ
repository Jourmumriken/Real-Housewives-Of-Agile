This report aims to show how the project of group 14, aka "The real housewives of agile", has progressed and what hardships were encountered and overcome. It will touch on the product side of things as well as the human side.

== The Product

TODO: Write about the priduct, should wait untill later in the sprint

== The Team

TODO: write about the teamwork and challenges faced.

Over the course of the project there have been a few issues.\
The largest, or most persistent, of them has been the team being too large and hard to coordinate. There simply isnt enough experience in the team to handle the task of organising itself as well as building a fully fledged project. This would at first lead to a separation of the team into two sub-teams. One working on the front-end and one on the back-end. This approach worked well as this meant two smaller teams that were easier to coordinate could work on the project in parallel thus eliminating the issue of having such a large team.\
This however did not last forever as eventually the front and back end were merged together to make one coherent product. At this point cooperating and coordinating became significantly harder and finding work for every member equaly was not simple. During these later sprints the result was some memebers doing more work or being more active while others did less work.\
The solution used was to make sure every member did something small, so that each memeber still could contribute. One example could be doing a small bugfix or researching some information for future sprints and so on.\
\
Another issue faced was the lack of experience within the team. Since the team consisted of mostly inexperienced students a significant portion of time was allocated to researching tools and figuring out the best way to do things. In the end this was solved by deciding not to use tools that were deemed impraactical to learn such as the react framework and using tools that were already familiar such as java and SQL as well as pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript.\
\
Of these two major issues the second could be considered more or less fully dealth with however the first only partially. This is the nature of such prjects and not much more could be done about this wihtout more rigorous planning and experience.
